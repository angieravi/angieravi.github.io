            Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Angie Ravi, and I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design with a minor in Computer Science. I am also pursuing certificates in sport studies and cybersecurity. Originally, I began my studies at Pittsburgh as a Neuroscience major but found myself more engaged in technological pursuits and changed my major once I felt ready. I am from a suburb outside of Philadelphia. I spend my free time drawing, spending time with my friends and family, listening to music, and watching sports-- specifically Chicago and Philly teams. I work for Underdog, a startup at the University of Pittsburgh that emphasizes self-defense and sexual assault awareness on campus, doing technological work and content creation for them. I am an avid book reader and movie watcher and can always look forward to immersing myself in either of those mediums. I am a proud daughter and eldest sister to one, and I am most definitely a cat person, although I love dogs as well.

                In my spare time, drawing is something I’ve always loved. I began sketching and doodling in middle school and naturally was no good at it. However, I enjoyed it nonetheless and found myself continuing to perfect my craft. As I got older and spent more time working on it, my skills began to get better and began to find my preferred formats and sketching utensils. Eventually, I got to a point where I began getting commissions from people close to me to make things for them and their loved ones. Overall, it’s a passion for me and I plan to continue doing it for as long as I can. It’s been fun incorporating it into the technological side of my studies.

                Another thing I enjoy is cooking and baking. I’ve always liked being able to create foods and indulge in them as well. I’ve never been a picky eater, thanks to my parents making sure I try all types of foods from a young age, and I thoroughly enjoy learning how to cook all types of cuisines and following along with baking recipes. The process is very peaceful to me and I feel it’s a useful skill that you genuinely can’t really go wrong with.
